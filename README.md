# FAC

## 🎯 Introduction
Hey there, CSS padawan! Ever had one of those moments when you feel like pulling your hair out trying to center a div? We've all been there, shouting into the abyss, "Why is it so hard to just center a div?" Well, worry no more, brave one, because we've got a magic mantra for you to remember - "Just FAC it!" 😉

## 📜 The Code
css
Copy code
.fac {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
### 🕵️‍♀️ Decoding the Magic
**display: flex;**
First, we FAC things up with display: flex;. That's right, we're invoking the mighty Flexbox, the ruler of layout land. It's got our backs when we want to place our child elements just right!

**justify-content: center;**
Next, we say "Just FAC it!" and use justify-content: center;. This is our secret code to align our div horizontally. Imagine a game of tug of war where both sides have an equal force - the result? The rope stays... you guessed it, in the center!

**align-items: center;**
Finally, we "FAC it to the limit" with align-items: center;. This powerful charm aligns our div vertically. It's as if gravity and anti-gravity decided to take a break and let our div float perfectly in the middle.

### 😌 Conclusion
And there you have it! The div is perfectly centered! Our fac class – or as we like to call it, Flexbox Align Center – is the solution to all your div centering woes. Slap it onto your div and watch as it glides smoothly into the center of its parent, defying the memes and legends of div centering difficulty!

But remember, with great power comes great responsibility. So, next time you're stuck with an off-center div, don't lose heart. Just FAC it! 😎👌

May the FAC be with you, always. 🙏🎯🔮
